From 2016 I started learning python in college. Since 2016 I have been working in a team of freelancers, projects on VueJS and Firebase. 2017-2018 independently designed and released a CMS for administering low-level Linux OS software (iptables, Docker containers, etc.) and sold it to the enterprise. Application stack: Flask, VueJS, Postgres, Docker. Now I look at major serious projects."
